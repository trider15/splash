<!-- Html div tags are used to divide the body of a website.. these divided sections can be changed in different ways -->
<!-- inline elements only take up the width of the content inside.. while block elements take up the whole width of the
webpage

There are four different display element types:
 1. inline -- width can't be changed.. multiple elements can exist on the same line
 2. block -- width can be changed, but no other elements can exist on the same line
 3. inline-block -- applies the properties of both inline and block.. the best of both worlds
 4. none -- hides the elemnent from the webpage

 Position property:
    4 positions; 1. Static, 2. Relative, 3. Absolute, 4. Fixed

    <h2>Hello.</h2>
    <p class="pic-bio">I am currently an IT Support Field Technician as a contractor for Prince William County, VA. I deliver excellent customer service and software/hardware troubleshooting skills to assist government employees to continue their work flow without a stoppage of downtime. I graduated from George Mason University with a Bachelors degree in Information Technology, and while working at current job position. I was excited to gain IT experience by challenging myself to continuing my education at Mason while also working in an IT position. I had joined an IT after-class group at my local community college before taking on my next ventures. I looked forward to putting my skills and experience to the test in a way I knew would shape the future of a business. <br><br>I am inspiring to become a software developer to create my own applications. I love working out at the gym to stay in shape and socializing with friends on my off time.<br><br>
